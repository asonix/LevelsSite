						<p>
						So I heard your shiny little secret</br>
						You look best in the image that you've crafted</br>
						Why did you try and hide it?</br>
						</br>
						I don't care what the textbooks say</br>
						We're getting this done with caffeine and sine waves</br>
						</br>
						So tell me why we can't have hopscotch daydreams?</br>
						Put our differences aside for just an hour</br>
						Why can't we see each other face to face?</br>
						When we're all identical no one's out of place</br> 
						</br>
						I got the feeling that there's something wrong</br>
						Counting the days 'till I'm back where I belong</br>
						And we're out they'll know us by our names</br>
						</br>
						Would you say? I do-</br>
						Would you follow me into the blue?</br>
						</br>
						I'm not exactly a knight in shining armor</br>
						Don't feel too bad - Set your sights on something greater</br>
						</br>
						And everybody's waiting at the finish line-</br>
						For this dreamer to make it-</br>
						Well you've got time-</br>
						And I'll help you fake it</br>
						</br>
						So tell me why we can't have hopscotch daydreams?</br>
						Put our differences aside for just an hour</br>
						Why can't we see each other face to face?</br>
						When we're all identical no one's out of place</br> 
						</br>
						I got the feeling that there's something wrong</br>
						Counting the days 'till I'm back where I belong</br>
						And we're out they'll know us by our names</br>
						</br>
						Would you say? I do-</br>
						Would you follow me into the blue?</br>
						</br>
						And if we come out, then we're coming together</br>
						If you trust me too, we'll collide, we'll hide our disguise</br>
						I've tried to prove it to you so many times</br>
						I think I deserve to see you open your eyes</br>
						</br>
						So tell me why we can't have hopscotch daydreams?</br>
						Put our differences aside for just an hour</br>
						Why can't we see each other face to face?</br>
						When we're all identical no one's out of place</br> 
						</br>
						I got the feeling that there's something wrong</br>
						Counting the days 'till I'm back where I belong</br>
						And we're out they'll know us by our names</br>
						</br>
						Would you say? I do-</br>
						Would you follow me into the blue?
